# Hello there! I'm @Pirraio.
I'm currently a student of Information Technology (IT) at UFRN (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte).
I love mathmatics, puzzles, music, science and of course, programming. I guess you can call me a nerd, I personally don't have a problem with that haha.

I know how to play keyboard and recorder, I intend in the future to learn how to play the guitar. Oh, I also know how to solve the Rubik's Cube! I like learning new things and new skills, the knowledge amazes me!

The main languages that I know are Python and JavaScript. I also know a bit of C.
